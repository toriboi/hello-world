# Hello World

Well, hello world!

I am Odonghanro, Faith Toritseju.

I am a graduate of Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria, from the Department of Computer Science.

I like to engineer software using multiple languages.

I recently discovered I know nothing, but I do have an insatiable desire to learn and improve.

I keep this repo to remind myself where I started from and how far I've gone.
